#Smolkraft
## The Crafter's ERP
### What's an ERP?
Enterprise Resource Planner
### Why do I need one?
To go from 0 to 1. If you want to turn your crafting hobby into a crafting business, you need to keep track of a whole bunch of stuff all at once, that you didn't before. Your materials, your expenditures, your time.
### How can Smolkraft help?
Smolkraft helps you keep track of your stock of materials and their usage. This lets you price your wares accurately (by deriving per-unit cost), keep track of production (by entering batch date and age), and organize your production (by keeping track of your recipes and processes for you).
